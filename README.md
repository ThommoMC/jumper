# Jumper

**Jumper** is a open source replacement for the Vector app!

Currently this app is **under development**, so feel free to check back later for updates!

## Planned Features
- Configure Bot Settings
- Easily switch between CFW
- Full Prod Compatibility
- Cross compatibility with all platforms (Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS and Android)

## For Developers/Contributors
This is a flutter based app, so you'll need to head over to the [Flutter Install Page](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and setup your target platform.
Then, clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/ThommoMC/jumper.git` and open it up in a IDE of your choosing.
You should be all setup to develop then, if you need any help or have questions feel free to reach out to me on discord.
