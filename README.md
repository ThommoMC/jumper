## For Developers/Contributors
This is a flutter based app, so you'll need to head over to the [Flutter Install Page](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and setup your target platform.
Then, clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/ThommoMC/jumper.git` and open it up in a IDE of your choosing.
You should be all setup to develop then, if you need any help or have questions feel free to reach out to me on discord.
